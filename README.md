Welcome to our home, we hope you will enjoy your stay!
Our address is Odelbergsvägen 36, Enskede gård. The entry code for the front door is
2007 and works until 22:00, after that you use the apartment key to enter. The key is
inside the blue sofa on our patio. You take to the left when exiting the subway station
and we live in the yellow house right in front of you. Follow the gravel path to the left
of the building into the park and our patio is the second one with no fence at the end
of the building. Here’s a google street view of the path leading into the park -

The closes subway stop is Enskede Gård, 100m from our home. It’s on the green line
#19 towards Hagsätra. We left four access cards on the kitchen table. They can be
charged with travel credits - “reskassa” - in the vending machine at the subway stop.
The one marked with an “X” is setup for regular fare, for the others you choose
regular for adult and reduced for the kids when you charge the cards. The cards can
be used on subway, trams and buses.
The tram line is called Tvärbanan and our closest stop, Linde, is 700m away. The
tram is closed this summer for maintenance work and has a replacement bus with
number 22B.

Taxi
Taxi from Arlanda is about 650SEK.
The main taxi company is Taxi Stockholm, http://www.taxistockholm.se, 08 15 00
00.

The car
Our car is parked in parking spot 3 facing the park. It’s a silver Toyota Corolla Verso
with FOX 506 on the plate. It has manual gear. It uses 95 octane petrol and there’s a

small lever down by the floor to the left of the driver’s seat which opens the gas cap.
There’s a driver’s manual in the glove compartment.
It’s insured and you don’t need any ownership papers, it’s enough to bring your
driver’s license while driving. The car key is on the kitchen table and there’s a spare
key in the wall cabinet next to the freezer.

Bedrooms
We made the beds with clean linens. At the end of the stay you can just strip the beds
and put them in the bathroom, and we will take care or the washing up. We didn’t
make Vide’s bed, but feel free to use it if you like.
Bathroom
There are clean towels hanging in the bathroom and more in the wall cabinet. The
washing powder is also in the cabinet.
Kitchen
Recycling is divided into regular trash, food scraps (brown paper bags), plastics,
metal, batteries, glass, colored glass, paper and cardboard. The bins are underneath
the sink, except for paper/cardboard which are in the linen cupboard, opposite Vide’s
room. The garbage room is to the right of the entrance of the opposite building,
number 34, and you use the apartment key to get in.
The espresso machine is powered using the left lever. Wait ~10 minutes for it to heat
up (the thermometer is broken), then toggle the middle lever. For cappuccino turn
the black wheel on the right hand side to release the steam.
There is also a percolator in the cupboard above the freezer.
Please take what you like in the fridge. And above the fridge there is some wine and
liquor - including a 60%(!) Swedish whiskey if you’d like to try. Please help
yourselves.

Livingroom
To use the TV set, open the cabinet and turn on the red power switch. Then use the
Samsung remote to choose source. The digital box is on ‘Ext.’ and you change
channels with the Motorola remote. The Apple TV is on ’HDMI1’ and the PS3 on
‘HDMI2’.

Our WiFi is called ’BigHero6-fast’ and the password is ‘oriavehl’. In case of
connectivity issues try powering off and on the router which you find in the small
office behind our bedroom.

Places
We’ve put together a map of different places in our neighborhood and around
Stockholm. Everything from grocery stores to museums and outdoor activities.
