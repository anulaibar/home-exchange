Our home is at [Odelbergsvägen 36, Enskede gård](https://goo.gl/maps/isqoTqnuZBR3AW246).

The entry code for the front door is **1472** and works until 10 PM - after that you use the apartment key to enter.

The key to our apartment is at our neighbours place - Jimmy Jansson & Victoria Nordahl.
They live in the opposite buildning - #34 - on the second floor. Use the same entry code - **1472** - to get in.
Jimmy and Victoria are on vacation, but their son Julius is at home and ready to hand you the keys.
He's expecting you at 3 pm on the 12th. His phone number is [072 248 16 07](tel:072 248 16 07).

### [Public transport](#public-transport)

Stockholm Local traffic, SL:
  - [Trip planner](http://sl.se/en/)
  - [Fares](http://sl.se/en/fares--tickets/)

You need an _access card_ for public transport which you buy for 20 SEK at the entrance at _Södra station_ where you arrive with your train.
The access card can then be charged with travel credits - “reskassa” - at the vending machines available at subway gates.

To get to our home you take any south bound commuter train from _Södra station_. Get off at _Årstaberg_ and change to the _tvärbanan_ tram towards _Sickla_.
Get off at _Linde_ tram stop and walk 700 meters to our home. [Check out directions](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Rf8esnCzxaSwK9yYA).

Our closest subway stop is _Enskede Gård_, 100 meters from our home.
It’s on the green line **#19** towards _Hagsätra_. Unfortunately the line is closed between _Globen_ and _Gullmarsplan_ for construction work during summer.
When going into the city you can take the subway from _Enskede gård_ to _Globen_ and then walk the one stop from _Globen_ to _Gullmarsplan_ - around 600 meters.
Or, you can take the _tvärbanan_ tram three stops from _Linde_ to _Gullmarsplan_ and then change to subway.

### Bedrooms

We made the beds with clean linen. At the end of the stay you can just strip the beds and put them in the bathroom, and we will take care or the washing up.
There are extra linens in the closet facing Vide and Egils room in case you need it.

### Bathroom

There are clean towels in the wall cabinet. The washing powder is also in the cabinet.

### Kitchen

Recycling is divided into regular waste, food scraps (brown paper bags), plastics, metal, batteries, glass, colored glass, paper and cardboard.
Paper/cardboard bins are in the linen cupboard, opposite Vide and Egils room.
The garbage room is to the right of the entrance of the opposite building, number 34, and you use the apartment key to get in.

Powder for the dishwasher is in the cupboard above the dishwasher.
There is a percolator for coffee in the cupboard above the freezer.
Please take what you like in the cupboard, fridge and freezer.

### Livingroom

To use the TV set, open the cabinet and turn on the red power switch. Then use the Samsung remote to choose source.
The digital box is on _Ext._ and you change channels with the Motorola remote.
The Apple TV is on _HDMI1_ and the PS3 on _HDMI2_.

Our WiFi is named _BigHero6_ and the password is _oriavehl_. In case of connectivity issues try powering the router off and on again.
The router is in the closet behind our bedroom.

### Patio

There's been construction work on our building during may-june, and it's not yet finished.
I think the patio will be in ok shape by the time you arrive, but I don't think the furniture will be put back in place by the construction workers.
If you want to sit there you can just arrange the sofa and the table so that you can use them.
Or just go take your morning coffee on the stairs by the playground which we often do.

### Bikes

I guess you won't take Tijl on a bike ride, but my black _Crescent_ is available for you.
The key is in the hall - it has a red and white cord that says _Ongame_.
There's a child seat either on the bike or in the storage room opposite our front door, use the apartment key to get in.

### Places to visit

We’ve put together a map of different places in our neighborhood and around Stockholm.
